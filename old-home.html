      <p class="paragraph">As a consequence of a fast expansion, relations between members of Nest Collective, a co-working space in Portugal, have started decreasing: it has became frequent for co-workers to <strong>not know each other</strong>. The space is at risk of loosing its community-oriented character, a trait that stays at the <strong>core of the business</strong>. <br><br>We sat down with the founders to create a solution able to improve the <strong>quality of relations </strong>between co-workers.</p>
      <h6 class="heading6-blue-big">MY ROLE</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">I worked as Product Designer in a team of six interns. I led <strong>user research phases</strong>: setting, running and documenting interviews and observations. Equally dividing responsibilities with the team, I <strong>ideated</strong>, <strong>prototyped</strong> (in Figma) and conducted <strong>user tests</strong> of the platform. I supported in the <strong>implementation</strong> of the platform front end (HTML, SASS).</p>

        <div class="column_card">
          <h5>· Communication about events is not well planned</h5>
          <p class="paragraph-small">Different  channels are used to share events (Slack, FB, Linkedin, mail, physical board in the office).  As a result, the attendance rate of events is low. Users also reported a mismatch between their interests and the events offered.  <br></p>

        <div class="column_card">
          <h5>· Hard to obtain relevant infos about other members</h5>
          <p class="paragraph-small">Hard to get to know everyone. Slack does not provide any personal information. Facebook is not used for work-related relationships, and Linkedin is mainly used for business purposes.  <br></p>

        <div class="column_card">
          <h5>· Managing spaces is problematic</h5>
          <p class="paragraph-small">There is not a single person responsible for the management of spaces. This creates a messy organisation of rooms occupancy, that gets critical during busy times.<br><br><br></p>
