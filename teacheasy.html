      <h6 class="heading6-blue-big">WHY WAS TEACHEASY BUILT</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">Problems related to <strong>communication between teachers</strong> were detected by the dean of a local school, but a clear <strong>understanding of their causes</strong> was lacking. <br><br>We were so requested to <strong>explore</strong> teachers impressions on their work relationships and analyse <strong>their perspective</strong> on internal processes.<br><br>After talking with users, we prototyped Teacheasy as a way for teachers to communicate better between themselves and with the school board, and a tool to help them in managing their daily work life.</p>
      <h6 class="heading6-blue-big">MY ROLE</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">I worked as <strong>UX Designer</strong> in a team of five students. I conducted <strong>user research</strong> to uncover problems felt by users and stakeholders. After analysing insights, I <strong>prototyped</strong> and <strong>tested </strong>both low and high-fidelity versions of it.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">When we initially sat down with the school dean, she expressed concerns for a <strong>lack of communication</strong> between her and the teachers, and also amid colleagues. Through interviews and a workshop, we both <strong>analysed this problem</strong> and <strong>uncovered some hidden ones</strong>.</p>

          <h5>Four user interviews</h5>
          <p class="paragraph-small">I personally interviewed 4 teachers. <br><br>Interviews were planned to validate the issues reported by the school board, obtain a better view of <strong>internal school processes</strong>, and understand teachers’ perception of problems.  <br><br>After transcribing interviews, it was possible to produce a list of frequent issues and topics to investigate further.<br></p>

          <h5>Co-design workshop</h5>
          <p class="paragraph-small">We wanted to investigate the context further, but keep on running interviews did not seem the best way to go. It was difficult for teachers to find time to attend them: the research process was at risk of drifting over the following weeks, something we’d liked to avoid! <br><br>As a solution to this issue, we gathered 12 teachers in the same room at the same time for a <strong>participatory design workshop</strong>.  In this way, extended knowledge was gained in a limited time frame. <br><br>We dug deeper into the topics that emerged from interviews and investigated their day to day life, how activities are structured in the school and divided between class teams.<br></p>

      <h3 class="heading-4">2020 redesign (extra)</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">I’ve taken some time to redesign some of the screens, in order to strengthen my UI design skills. The original prototype is from 2018, following design patterns and visual design choices that could result quite outdated.<br></p>

      <h3 class="heading-4">Results</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">The prototype was presented back to the school, and <strong>positively received</strong> by the major and the school teachers. The teachers liked how their problems were translated into features of the prototype, and the major appreciated the knowledge gained. <br><br>However, as the final result was a prototype that will be hardly implemented, we also provided a series of physical, ready to use <strong>paper templates</strong> to improve weekly meetings. The templates reproduced the features of the application in a paper based version. <br><br>In this way, teachers had an immediately actionable tool to better manage weekly meetings.  <br></p>
