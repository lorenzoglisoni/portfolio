      <h5 class="heading-5_big">All Of Us Social is an early stage startup that is creating an engagement platform built around Diversity &amp; Inclusion. <br><br>During my time here, as a Product Designer in a design team of two, I worked on building a culture of UX research, refining design system components, bringing usability improvements to existing features, as well as designing new ones for both web and mobile version of the platform.<br><br>I’ve collected here some reflections and learnings that I gained by being exposed to the life of a startup.<br><br><br><br></h5>

        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">Being a designer in a small and fast paced team means finding <strong>quick solutions for unexpected problems</strong>. That is different from finding solution quickly. <br><br>I realised that often <strong>great improvements come from small fixes</strong>, and part of our job as designers is to find what&#x27;s the minimum meaningful change to apply to a state in order to improve it, and start building from that. <br></p>

        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">Constraints coming from the client, from the stakeholders, from technology exist, and need to be taken into account when designing. <br><br>Part of our job as designers is to learn how to<strong> mediate</strong> between them. To discover turnarounds. To understand how to crete value to all the parts.<br></p>

          <h3 class="space-less">The process is fluid</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">Coming out of university, I was in love with the design process  (and I still am). But I discovered that the process is ideal. Often,  it does not happen as in the books. What I realised is that there&#x27;s <strong>no one-size-fits-all process</strong>.<br><br>During my time at All Of Us Social, sometimes the time frame and the typology of the project allowed me to plan and follow an established design process, for example when redesigning the admin panel. Some other times, I just could not go through all the steps as I planned. Other times, I found myself in unpleasant situation for a designer. I had to work backwards when the technical part of a new feature was coded before any input from design. I struggled, but learned how to deal with this. <br><br>The lesson I got from this is that we as designers need to be <strong>aware of the process</strong>, conscious of it, and <strong>prepared to the uncertainty</strong> of the real world.<br></p>

          <h3 class="space-less">Design needs shared understanding</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">UX is a team effort. Developers, PO, Content and Marketing need to understand what design is. What research means. As an established design process was not in place when I joined, I could practice how to structure it.<br><br>Most of the tech team of All Of Us Social is remote. I had so to improve how I share design decisions, documentation, research insights inside a distributed team. I learned how documenting every passage is crucial. <br><br>I had to find ways to bring my team members into the loop, to build understanding of UX. To create that shared understanding of problems and users that is the foundation of carefully created solutions. I used Loom to share my design decisions, so to bring in developers early in the design process. I introduced a time for formalised design critiques. <br><br>Not everything went smooth from the beginning: it has been hard to gather users for testing sessions. To make team members aware of the value of personas or of the need of early usability testing. Coordinating this remotely has been an additional challenge as well.<br></p>

          <h3 class="space-less">Consider all the states </h3>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">As the platform is live and working, I had to take into account the diverse states and interactions when designing it. <strong>Don&#x27;t just design the happy path, consider all states and edge cases</strong>. Errors, hover, selection, long text, empty states, loading, responsiveness.<br><br>Something that as a student I did not really take into consideration. I learned to start designing from mobile up to web to ease the friction coming from responsiveness. I brought improvements to the current components.<br><br>When I joined the company, the visual direction for the platform had already been defined. I learned how to use, reuse and improve a <strong>growing design system</strong>.<br></p>
